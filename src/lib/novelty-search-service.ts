INVENTION TITLE: {title}

INVENTION DESCRIPTION:

{rawIdea}

OUTPUT FORMAT â€” Return ONLY valid JSON (one object). No markdown fences, no pre/post text, no explanations.

{

  "searchQuery": "plain-English query ≤35 words describing what the invention is and how it works, suitable for patent database search",

  "invention_features": ["feature 1", "feature 2", "feature 3"],

  "inventionType": ["MECHANICAL", "SOFTWARE"]

}

GLOBAL RULES

- Output must be valid JSON (double-quoted keys/values, comma-separated).
- "inventionType": Select 1-2 best fit archetypes for the invention logic.
  - MECHANICAL: Physical structures, moving parts, tools, housing, hinges.
  - SOFTWARE: Algorithms, data processing, AI, cloud platforms, blockchain.
  - CHEMICAL: Compounds, compositions, formulations, synthesis methods.
  - ELECTRICAL: Circuits, sensors, power systems, semiconductors, signal processing.
  - BIO: Genetics, proteins, medical treatments, diagnostics, organisms.
  - GENERAL: Fallback if no specific fit.

- Return only the JSON object; nothing else.

- Use ASCII characters only.

- Do not repeat identical phrases between "searchQuery" and any item in "invention_features".

- Avoid speculative claims, performance metrics, marketing language, or legal claim phrasing.

SEARCH QUERY (field: "searchQuery")

- ≤35 words, plain English, no boolean operators, no special query syntax.

- Convey the core technical concept and the key operating mechanism(s); ignore business use cases and background context.

- Use general technical terms that maximize recall while preserving the invention's distinctive mechanism(s).

FEATURE LIST (field: "invention_features")

- Return 3â€“8 items; each 3â€“8 words.

- Each item must be a distinct technical mechanism, structure, configuration, process step, or algorithmic controlâ€”not a benefit, result, or application context.

- Phrase features broadly enough to capture synonyms and domain-equivalent terms; avoid proprietary names.

- No overlap or near-duplicates across items.

GENERIC COMPONENT HANDLING

- Do NOT list trivial, everyday components (e.g., processor, memory, sensor, transceiver, database, display, battery, network module, housing, server, API) as standalone features.

- Include such elements ONLY when they play a non-obvious role or participate in a novel configuration/interaction/control logic/material property.

- Prefer integrating generics into higher-level mechanisms (e.g., "feedback-controlled microfluidic delivery" rather than separate "controller" and "pump").

QUALITY FILTERS (apply to both fields)

- Avoid outcome/benefit-only phrases (e.g., "real-time monitoring", "smart control") unless coupled to a concrete mechanism.

- Prefer integrative/feedback mechanisms that tie sensing â†” processing â†” actuation (or domain equivalents).

- Remove filler adjectives (e.g., smart, efficient, robust) unless technically specific.

- Keep nouns/noun-phrases primary; verbs only where they define a process step or control logic.

DOMAIN ADAPTATION (choose expressions appropriate to the invention's field)

- Mechanical/Civil/Materials: express mechanisms as configurations, load/flow/thermal paths, material-geometry relationships, joining/fabrication processes, kinematics/actuation.

- Electronics/Embedded/Comms: express data paths, control logic, signal processing chains, power/latency/energy mechanisms, protocol/architecture specifics where non-obvious.

- Software/AI/Data: express model class/learning or inference mechanism, control policy, data structures/flows, algorithmic pipelines; avoid "software module" generics.

- Medical Devices/Biomed: express biosensing/transduction principles, closed-loop control, delivery/actuation mechanisms, physiological interfacing, packaging/form factor integrations.

- Biotech/Pharma/Chem: express molecular structures/classes, formulation components/ratios, binding/interaction mechanisms, reaction pathways, process steps, release profiles, scaffold/vehicle properties.

CONSTRAINTS & VALIDATION

- If the invention has fewer than 3 core mechanisms, return fewer items (do not pad with generic or redundant features).

- Do not include citations, references, or prior-art IDs.

- Do not include units, claims language ("comprising/wherein"), or legal boilerplate.

FAIL-SAFES

- If uncertain, prioritize the most distinctive mid-level mechanisms (integration, control loop, configuration, interaction) over lists of generic parts or high-level benefits.

INVENTION TITLE: {title}

INVENTION DESCRIPTION:
{rawIdea}

OUTPUT JSON SHAPE:
{
  "searchQuery": "plain-English patent search query, 12-35 words",
  "invention_features": ["mechanism-level feature"],
  "inventionType": ["MECHANICAL|SOFTWARE|CHEMICAL|ELECTRICAL|BIO|GENERAL"],
  "cpcCodes": ["optional CPC class hint, or empty array"],
  "ipcCodes": ["optional IPC class hint, or empty array"],
  "novelty_focus": ["feature most likely to drive novelty"],
  "search_exclusions": ["term that should not dominate search"],
  "confidence": 0.0,
  "warnings": ["coverage or ambiguity warning"]
}

RULES:
- JSON only. No markdown, comments, citations, or text before/after JSON.
- Use ASCII only.
- Do not invent technical facts not present in the disclosure.
- The search query is used as the single PQAI query and as the broad local-corpus concept query.
SEARCH QUERY DISCIPLINE:
- The searchQuery is for retrieving the closest prior art, not for proving novelty.
- Build searchQuery around the broad technical object, core operation, and baseline mechanism that older patents are likely to describe.
- If the invention contains both a known baseline workflow and a narrower improvement, put the baseline workflow in searchQuery and put the narrower improvement in novelty_focus.
- Do not overload searchQuery with every differentiator, threshold, formula, species, cryptographic step, exact sensor type, data format, material ratio, performance limit, or special embodiment unless that detail is essential to identify the invention category.
- A good searchQuery should still retrieve close prior art that lacks the invention's newest improvement.
- Construct searchQuery using this pattern when possible: technical object/system/process + primary operation + core mechanism/transformation + target object/material/data/condition.
- The search query must describe what the invention is and how it works, not its market benefit.
- Keep searchQuery broad and self-contained; do not stuff it with every feature.
- Prefer recall-oriented technical terms and preserve only the most central operating mechanism needed to find close prior art; avoid packing searchQuery with secondary refinements that belong in novelty_focus.
- Return 3-8 invention_features unless the disclosure truly contains fewer.
- Each feature must be a claim-relevant mechanism, structure, material relationship, control loop, process step, data flow, or algorithmic transformation.
- Each invention_feature is independently embedded for local Indian abstract search; write it as a standalone 3-10 word technical phrase.
- Order invention_features from broad core mechanisms to narrower differentiators.
- The first 2-4 features should describe baseline mechanisms likely to retrieve close prior art.
- Later features may capture narrower improvements or differentiators.
- Do not extract only the newest or most specific improvements; include the baseline mechanism that makes the invention searchable.
- Do not make features depend on the title or searchQuery for meaning.
- Do not repeat the full searchQuery or broad application field in every feature.
- Do not use benefits as features, such as "improved efficiency", "real-time monitoring", or "secure access", unless paired with a concrete mechanism.
- Do not list generic components as standalone features: processor, memory, sensor, controller, module, database, server, app, battery, housing, network, or API.
- Include generic components only when their specific interaction is material to novelty.
- novelty_focus must contain 1-4 features from invention_features that are most likely to distinguish over prior art.
- novelty_focus should hold differentiators that may be too narrow for the main searchQuery but important for later novelty assessment.
- novelty_focus must not include ordinary field-common parts unless their specific interaction is the likely inventive contribution. Prefer features involving a control relationship, material relationship, formulation ratio, biological target interaction, structural geometry, process sequence, signal-processing transformation, or measurable technical effect.
- cpcCodes and ipcCodes should be empty arrays unless the class is strongly inferable from the disclosure.
- search_exclusions should contain incidental, business-oriented, user-context, brand, marketing, or overly narrow embodiment terms that may pull irrelevant references or suppress close prior art.
- confidence reflects disclosure sufficiency for novelty search, not patentability.
- warnings should call out missing mechanism detail, vague terms, missing materials/steps, or weak search coverage risks.

Return ONLY one valid JSON object.

INPUTS
FEATURES: {invention_features}
PATENTS: {patent_batch} (objects with pn, title, abstract, optional claims, link)

TASK
For every patent and feature, decide:
- "Present" → mechanism clearly described in the text
- "Partial" → related but missing a key element
- "Absent" → not supported by the text

Use title/abstract/claims text only.
Match by meaning (synonyms, paraphrases) but require concrete evidence; generic words like "AI", "sensor", "module", "controller" don't qualify unless they implement the full mechanism.

When Present/Partial, quote ≤25 words from the patent as evidence (direct quote + optional short paraphrase ≤ 20 words).
If Absent, give a ≤20 word reason.

INPUTS
FEATURES: {invention_features}  (array of strings; copy each feature verbatim)
PATENTS: {patent_batch}  (repeated blocks with lines: PN, Title, Abstract)

TASK
For each patent PN, classify EVERY feature EXACTLY ONCE as:
- Present = mechanism clearly described with concrete wording
- Partial = related but missing a required element/constraint
- Absent = no concrete evidence in Title/Abstract

Use Title/Abstract text only.

SEMANTIC MATCHING
- Treat synonyms/paraphrases/hypernyms/hyponyms as matches if they implement the same mechanism.
- Example equivalences:
  - "AI-based image analysis" ~= "computer vision", "intelligent image processing", "image recognition", "machine vision".
  - "object detection" ~= "detecting objects", "localizing targets".
  - "classify images" ~= "image classification", "recognition via ML/CNN model".
- Present when the quote shows the mechanism in action (verb + object). Avoid generic mentions like "AI module" without the image mechanism.
- Partial when related terms appear but a required element/constraint is missing (e.g., the real-time or edge aspect).
- Absent only when no concrete evidence for the mechanism exists in Title/Abstract.

EVIDENCE AND CONFIDENCE
- Quotes must be verbatim and <= 18 words from Title/Abstract; include the decisive mechanism phrase.
- Confidence rubric: 0.9-1.0 explicit phrase match; 0.6-0.8 clear paraphrase; 0.3-0.5 weak/indirect hint.

INPUTS
FEATURES: {invention_features} (array of strings; copy each feature verbatim)
PATENTS: {patent_batch} (repeated blocks with PN, Title, Abstract, optional Retrieval hints)

TASK
For each patent PN, classify EVERY feature EXACTLY ONCE:
- Present: the same mechanism is concretely disclosed in Title/Abstract.
- Partial: related mechanism is disclosed, but a required element, constraint, interaction, material, or step is missing.
- Absent: the Title/Abstract gives no support for the feature.
- Unknown: the text is too thin, generic, unclear, or unavailable to assess.

NOVELTY EVIDENCE RULES
- Use only the supplied Title/Abstract. Do not assume claims or missing details.
- Retrieval hints are candidate-discovery signals only. They are not evidence.
- Use Retrieval hints to focus review, but Present/Partial still require Title/Abstract support.
- Treat synonyms and paraphrases as matches only when they implement the same mechanism.
- Generic mentions of processor, sensor, controller, AI, module, app, server, or network do not satisfy a feature unless the full interaction is disclosed.
- Present/Partial require a verbatim quote <= 18 words and a field of "title" or "abstract".
- Absent requires a short reason.
- Unknown must be used when evidence is weak; do not convert missing abstracts into positive novelty.
- A feature marked Absent or Unknown in one patent is not automatically unique. It is only a potential differentiator if it is absent from the closest references and is not a generic field-common component.

GUIDELINES:
- Generate detailed attorney-style analysis for each selected patent
- Include feature-by-feature comparisons with technical depth
- Provide strategic insights for patent prosecution
- Ensure all hyperlinks work for navigation
- Format tables cleanly with proper alignment
- Use professional legal terminology appropriate for patent analysis`


// V2: Compact Stage 4 prompt aligned to the Stage 4 UI.
// Focuses on a small, JSON-only output without perâ€‘patent tables to reduce tokens.
/* LEGACY: live Stage 4 uses STAGE4_REPORT_PROMPT_FROM_REMARKS_V3 */
// Lightweight prompt: compile final report strictly from per-patent remarks
/* LEGACY: superseded by STAGE4_REPORT_PROMPT_FROM_REMARKS_V3 */

IMPORTANT: Detailed per-patent analysis is already provided in Stage 3.5c. Your role is to provide FINAL STRATEGIC CONCLUSIONS.

Use the following inputs only for reasoning — do not echo them back verbatim:
- invention_features: {invention_features}
- selected_patents: {selected_patents} (includes per_patent_remarks with detailed analysis from Stage 3.5c)
- search_metadata: {search_metadata}
- feature_analysis_matrix: {feature_analysis_matrix}
- structured_narrative: {structured_narrative}

Objectives:
- Provide HONEST, STRAIGHTFORWARD final assessment based on the closest matching patents.
- Give actionable recommendations on how to make the invention MORE NOVEL.
- Suggest course corrections or improvements if novelty is threatened.
- Be candid about risks - if a patent anticipates the invention, say so clearly.

Hard constraints:
- Return valid JSON only (no markdown, no prose before/after).
- Do NOT include per_patent_analysis (that's in Stage 3.5c now).
- Keep the executive summary under 250 words; each bullet under 18 words.
- Focus on STRATEGIC GUIDANCE, not detailed patent comparisons.

- idea_bank_suggestions should help pivot or strengthen against identified weakness

export const STAGE4_REPORT_PROMPT_FROM_REMARKS_V3 = `You are a senior patent novelty analyst preparing the final novelty assessment from per-patent threat remarks.

INPUTS PROVIDED BELOW:
- invention_features: JSON array of mechanism-level features
- per_patent_remarks: JSON array with pn, title, relevance, novelty_threat, overlap_features, missing_features, detailedAnalysis
- search_metadata: JSON object with search and filtering counts
- metrics: JSON object with deterministic novelty_score, decision, and confidence

TASK
Synthesize an honest, evidence-based novelty report. Do not re-run feature mapping. Do not treat missing abstracts or weak corpus coverage as novelty.

DECISION POLICY
- Not Novel: one patent covers most core features, or all critical features are present/obvious.
- Partially Novel: important overlap exists, but some mechanism-level differentiators remain.
- Novel: strong evidence shows closest references miss the core inventive mechanism.
- Low Evidence: evidence is too thin, missing, ambiguous, or corpus coverage is weak.

STRICT RULES
- Return valid JSON only. No markdown or text outside JSON.
- Be candid and skeptical; do not advocate for the invention.
- Distinguish "not found in evidence" from "novel".
- Name the closest blocking references by PN.
- Include confidence drivers and weak evidence areas.
- Keep executive summary under 220 words and bullets under 18 words.
- If the closest reference discloses most broad structural/process/composition/data-flow elements, state that broad claims are weak even if a narrower differentiator remains.
- Do not list as key_strengths any feature that is Present or Partial in the closest blocking reference.
- key_risks must reflect any risk stated in the executive summary, novelty basis, or filing advice. Never output "No significant risks identified" if any anticipation, obviousness, majority-overlap, or weak-evidence risk is discussed elsewhere.

PATENT TO ASSESS:
- Publication Number: ${(patent as any).publicationNumber || (patent as any).patentNumber || 'Unknown'}
- Title: ${(patent as any).title || 'Not available'}
- Abstract: ${(patent as any).abstract || 'Not available'}

TASK:
Determine if this patent is RELEVANT to the invention by identifying overlap between the patent's title/abstract and the invention features.

RELEVANCE CRITERIA:
- Patent title/abstract indicates presence of at least one invention feature with technical proximity
- If none of the features appear present, mark as not relevant
- A patent is not relevant merely because it discloses one generic component. If only one generic feature overlaps, return is_relevant=false unless the same object, same operation, or same technical problem is also present.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Respond with ONLY a JSON object:
{
  "is_relevant": boolean,
  "confidence": "HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW",
  "reasoning": "brief explanation (max 50 words)"
}

- Left brain: ruthless patent examiner who kills any idea that is obvious under 35 U.S.C. §103 or abstract under §101.
- Right brain: visionary CTO who invents only "white-space" solutions that make the cited references obsolete.

Both brains must co-sign every concept or it is rejected.

INVENTION CONTEXT:
Title: ${title}
Search Query: ${query}

CORE OBJECTIVE:
The user is looking for "White Space" inventions—areas where no patent currently exists.
Do not just improve the references. Make them obsolete.
Think from First Principles: What is the fundamental physics/logic limit here, and how do we bypass it?

INVENTION BRIEFING:
Generate exactly 5 patent-grade concepts that:
1. Are **orthogonal** to every mechanism disclosed in REFERENCES.
2. Contain at least one **physical structure** or **chemical composition** (no pure algorithms, no "AI to optimize").
3. Can be **enabled** by a PHOSITA with only routine experimentation (no perpetual motion, no room-temperature superconductors unless you supply the formula).
4. Pass the **"cold shower" test**: if you woke up tomorrow and read the claim on the front page of TechCrunch, you would think "wow, that's clever—and nobody did that before."

CREATIVITY FILTERS (apply ≥1 per idea):
A. **Anti-Solution**: Invert the primary physical state (e.g., if it's rigid, make it fluid; if it's centralized, make it swarm-based).
B. **Resource Starvation**: Design for zero electricity, zero RF bandwidth, or zero rare-earth materials.
C. **Biomimicry**: Copy a biological mechanism that has **no** existing engineering analog in the field.
D. **Dimensional Shift**: Replace spatial hardware with temporal encoding, or vice-versa.
E. **Cross-Pollination**: Import a physical phenomenon from an unrelated domain (e.g., high-frequency trading latency-arbitrage → ultrasonic acoustic arbitrage in concrete sensing).

OUTPUT SPECIFICATION:
Return ONLY valid JSON with exactly this schema.
