Lead logically to a general technical problem.

DO NOT disclose, preview, or characterize the invention or its solution.

────────────────────────────────────────
INPUT DISCIPLINE (CRITICAL)
────────────────────────────────────────
You will receive Normalized Data as read-only context.

RULES FOR USING THE CONTEXT:

Use it ONLY to identify the general technical field and maintain consistent field-level terminology.

Do NOT introduce feature-level detail that could resemble a claim element.

Do NOT narrow the field to the specific invention or solution space.

────────────────────────────────────────
MANDATORY PATENT DISCIPLINE
────────────────────────────────────────

Use neutral, impersonal patent language throughout.

Do NOT cite research papers, standards, products, or patent documents unless explicitly provided.

Do NOT describe embodiments, implementations, or “the invention.”

Do NOT imply novelty, superiority, inventive step, or commercial value.

Avoid admissions; if generic framing is required, use cautious language such as
“in some cases,” “certain approaches,” “may,” or “can.”

Avoid academic or narrative transitions such as:
“therefore,” “thus,” “hence,” “as a result,” “studies show.”

────────────────────────────────────────
CONTENT STRUCTURE (STRICT)

Draft the Background using the following logical progression ONLY:

A) TECHNICAL CONTEXT

Describe the broader technical field relevant to the problem.

Keep the description general and factual.

Do NOT narrow the field to the specific solution space.

B) EXISTING APPROACHES

Describe categories of existing or conventional approaches at a high technical level.

Refer to them generically (e.g., “some existing systems,” “certain techniques”).

Do NOT attribute features that resemble the claimed invention.

C) TECHNICAL LIMITATIONS

Identify technical limitations, constraints, or inefficiencies associated with such approaches.

Each limitation must be framed as a technical shortcoming, not a criticism.

Do NOT hint at how any limitation could be solved.

D) RESULTING TECHNICAL PROBLEM

Conclude by stating the general technical problem that remains unresolved.

Frame the problem broadly enough to avoid limiting claim scope.

────────────────────────────────────────
PARAGRAPH DISCIPLINE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
────────────────────────────────────────

Use short, atomic paragraphs.

One paragraph = one idea or limitation.

Each paragraph must contain EXACTLY 2–3 sentences.

Avoid long, flowing narrative paragraphs.

────────────────────────────────────────
LANGUAGE CONSTRAINTS
────────────────────────────────────────

Prefer: “may,” “can,” “in some cases,” “often,” “tends to.”

Avoid: “must,” “always,” “only,” “necessarily.”

Avoid comparative or evaluative terms such as:
“better,” “improved,” “efficient,” “optimal,” “advanced.”

────────────────────────────────────────
OUTPUT RULES
────────────────────────────────────────

Output ONLY the Background of the Invention text.

Do NOT include headings, bullet points, numbering, explanations, or commentary.

Do NOT mention claims, figures, embodiments, or the invention.
